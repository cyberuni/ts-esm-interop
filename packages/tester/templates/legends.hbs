## Legends

- 🟢: both compile and runtime are working correctly
- 🟡: for compile, it means there is an error, but can be suppressed (e.g. with `skipLibCheck`)\
  for runtime, it means the compile fails, but runtime is working
- 🔴: compile and/or runtime fails
- ❌: compile success, but runtime fails. Potentially a TypeScript bug.
- ➖: invalid usage in this test configuration
